# Raycasting
 Java implementation of a raycasting algorithm to view a randomly-generated maze in 3D.

Run Main.java to view the project.

Controllable with WASD for motion and Mouse for changing viewing angle (looking around). 

No barrier implementation for the walls of the maze as of now. Might add later. For now, it's a visual field one can walk through!
